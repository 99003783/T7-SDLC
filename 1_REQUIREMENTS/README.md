Introduction-
Calculator is a small, portable electronic device used to perform basic and complex operations of arithmetic. The common components of calculator are keypad, LCD Display, Battery or solar cell. 

Research-
Some of the most popular calculator types are listed below.
 
Basic Calculators
Scientific Calculators
Graphing Calculators
Financial Calculators
Printing Calculators

Basic Calculators: These are the most common and basic calculators for simple arithmetic calculation like adding, subtracting, multiplication, division, percentage calculation. Some of the calculators have memory and check function as advanced feature. There are two types in Basic Calculator :
1.Pocket Calculator 
2.Desktop Calculator
These calculators most commonly comes in LCD display capacity of 8 digits to 12 digits. Basic Calculator priced from Rs. 100 to Rs. 400 depending on features and brands. Basic calculator generally used in Home and Office.

Scientific Calculators: These calculators can perform higher arithmetic and trigonometric calculations. It is generally used by higher education students and engineers. 240+ functions makes it easy to perform all types of scientific calculations. Their range varies between Rs. 500 to Rs. 1000 depending on the features and brands.

Financial Calculators: A financial calculator is a calculator that performs financial functions commonly needed in business. For many direct financial calculations it has standalone keys that differentiate it from standard calculators. It may allow the user to program functions that the manufacturer has not provided by default. Their range varies from Rs. 3000 to Rs. 5000 in accordance to the brands and features.

Printing Calculators: These are similar to basic calculator that makes basic arithmetic calculation but has in-built printer to print the data and results in structured way. It is generally used in businesses where immediate print copy has to be made. Their rang varies from Rs. 1000 to Rs. 5000 according to the size, features and brands.
